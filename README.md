# HueRandomizer
HueDebugging is a mod for [Hue](https://www.huethegame.com/) that randomizes the order of all puzzle levels.
This mod makes it so you start in Hue's house and any level that does not contain a puzzle is skipped.

The seed that is used to randomize the levels can be found and changed in the settings menu (open/close with `ctrl + F10` by default).
Setting the seed to 0 will cause the game to generate a random seed.

# Setup

1. Download `UnityModManager.zip` from https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21/ (you can use the mirror download if you don't have a login)
1. Extract the archive (e.g. to desktop, do not copy it to the game folder.) and run `UnityModManager.exe` (recommended to run as administrator)
